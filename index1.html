  <h1>INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY SIMON GAME</h1>


  <ol>
    <li>Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.</li>

    <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.</li>


    <li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>

    <li>Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.</li>

    <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.</li>
